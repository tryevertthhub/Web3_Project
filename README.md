# Try Ethereum

## What is this?

I started this site as a simple way to list the best dApps that are working on the Ethereum main-net right now.

## Criteria

All the projects listed here have a few things in common:

1. Great user experience. This goes right from the end user delivered to the design of the interface.
2. Community support. People from the community have used/tried this dApp and would recommend it to others.

## Listing 

If you'd like to submit your project, please send me a DM (@kermankohli) and then create a PR. You can edit/add projects directly at `/src/constants/items.ts`
